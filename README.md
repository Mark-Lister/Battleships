# Battleships
Battleships game using some design patterns

Mark Lister

I recommend having the console covering half the screen and the GUI the other half so you don't have to alt-tab a lot.

To play please run the main class and follow the instructions I recommend auto placing ships when prompted to make the setup process fast... Then you can start by typing a X coord then Y coord when prompted and the game will keep going until you sink all of the computer ships or it sinks all of yours.

In the GUI the bottom half is the view of your grid and ships, the top half is the computer grid where you will shoot too. On your grid the dark blue squares are your ships. When there's a green square in either grid that is a shot that has missed a ship whereas a red square is a shot that hit a ship!
